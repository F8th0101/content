                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">The interesting article on the port of Alex andria from the
                            December Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce, which we published
                            on Tuesday, deserves more than their passing notice which we gave of it,
                            more especially in view of Lord Cromer's answer to the petition of the
                            Chamber of Shipping, which we publish in another portion of to day's
                            issue. Mr. Cornish is surprised that the system adopted at Marseilles
                            (and other ports where there are artificially closed basins) for
                            economizing quay space by mooring ships ``end on" for the purpose of
                            loading and discharging, instead of broadside to the quays, is not in p
                            use at Alexandria. The same surprise has been expressed by many others,
                            very tre. quently, during the past eighteen or twenty years. The
                            explanation is that when the Egyptian Government, thirty-five years ago,
                            decided to carry out the existing harbor works at Alexandria, the
                            intention was to 80 close in the quaye at which the ships of the
                            Rubattino, Prince Line, Austrian Lloyd, Messageries, Ellerman, Russian,
                            and Moss S.S. Companies are now berthed that the "endon" system of
                            mooring them might be adopted. With this view, the arm which forms Quay
                            E, now occupied by Messrs. Tamvaco and Carver, and the timber trade, and
                            ends abruptly at Berth 16, was projected in the direction of the N.-W.
                            corner of the Arsenal mole, parallel to the general line of quaye,
                            leaving only an opening near the Arsenal for the entrance and exit of
                            steamers. Such a protecting mole was obviously essential to enable the
                            "end ons system of berthing ships to be carried out i with security to
                            them and to the operations I b of loading and discharge on a "dead lee
                            shore," with 4 of a mile drift of open water towards Ras-el Tin in the
                            direction of the prevailing wind. When the arm we have spoken of had
                            reached its present termination, it was thought i that, as the
                            Mahmoudieh Canal would be lo constantly pouring mud and impurities of
                            all kinds into an enclosed space with scarcely any tide to scour it out,
                            this might be productive of sickness as well as the rapid silting up of
                            the anchorage, and that the long role ! might prove a serious
                            inconvenience to the manæuvring of the ships ; 80, after much!
                            discussion, the late Admiral McKillop, who was strongly of this opinion,
                            succeeded in getting the direction of the mole changed | as we now see
                            it. The boat passage at the inner end of the great breakwater was left,
                            mainly, for the above mentioned sanitary reasons, but a short breakwater
                            outside the boat passage! was, doubtless, intended to be added, as a
                            security to boats and to prevent the swell from entering the port.</hi>

                    <p>In spite of cold and rather dull weather the first important race-day of the
                        Cairo season was a great success. There could be no two opinions as to the
                        quality of the racing. It was good, and the attendance had reached very
                        respectable proportions by 3 p.m., if a little thin during the first race or
                        two. Among those present were nearly all the principal owners, of whom
                        Khalil Pasha Khayat, with one first and two seconds, did best. But for a
                        mistake by Jenkins in the first race, he might have obtained-1 ed another
                        win, though Stillwell, on Parbon II, would in any case have been a
                        formidable competitor. The Grand Khedivial Steeplechase produced an
                        interesting race, but the great! The attraction of the day was, of course,
                        that for the Jubilee Stakes, which was won by Pantasia. On ) weighing,
                        however, Ibrahim Bey Cherif's joe-li key was about half a pound underweight
                        and the race went to Roland, which, if not a general favorite, had been most
                        confidently backed by his owner. Mathews, who rode Amory and came in fourth,
                        did not weigh out, and so lost the third place, which would otherwise have
                        fallen to him consequent disgust of the hope-13 ful few who had backed Elie
                        Bey Sursock's horse. In the last race Moofid ran disappointingly and Roi de
                        l'Air failed to keep up, giving Khalil Pasha Khayal's Banaback a well
                        deserved win. The Band of the 2nd Royal Inniskilling 1 Fusiliers played
                        during the afternoon, and all the arrangements of the K.S.C. were excellent.
                        The Pari Mutuel paid pretty well, especially in the 2nd and 5th races. In
                        the great race India, Paik, and Latiff were most fancied by the public.
                        Roland's backing was limited-but successful.</p>

                        <p>DEVELOPMENTS.</p>
                        <p>The approaching establishment of the Ma. tual Life Association of
                            Australasia (Limited) at Cairo las created considerable interest in
                            commercial and financial circles in Egypt. The new Egyptian brauch is to
                            be opened at Cairo on New Year's Day, and a branch at Alexandria will be
                            opened very shortly. Mr. Gilleson, the London manager of the head office
                            in England, arrived at Cairo yesterday and will superintend the
                            inauguration in Egypt. The offices of the company will be in the
                            courtyard of the Cairo Stock Exchange. The great feature of this
                            assurance company, apart from the very low rates, is that there is no
                            forfeiture of policies. This innovation was started by this company some
                            years ago and has been 80 successful that it has already found many
                            imitators among the leading Assurance companies throughout the world.
                            The clauso in question runs as follows:</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of the Association's non-forfeiture clause not only
                            is the policy kept in force after default in paying the renewal premium,
                            but all the rights of the policy holder (including that of renewal) are
                            conserved until the surrender value of the policy is exhausted, and this
                            without any previous application from</p>
                        <p>the policyholder. This company, starting, as it does, under the auspices
                            of such an energetic administrator as Sir William Willcocks, deserves to
                            have a most successful career in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>PRIZE GIVING ATSHUBRA SCHOOL.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, the Countess of Cromer gave away the prizes at the above
                            school. Lord Crorner was present, and there was a large gathering of the
                            parents of the pupils. Dean Butcher delivered a short address describing
                            the origin and objects of the school. Songs and recitations by the
                            children followed, some in English and some in French. The pronunciation
                            of the children was singularly distinot and clear. Lady Cromer gave away
                            the prizes for good conduct and regular attendance. A vote of thanks was
                            proposed by Rev. H. Cooper and a bouquet presented to Lady Uromer. An
                            excellent tes was provided for the children.</p>
                        <p>The speakers offered a hearty tribute to Miss Taylor, the head mistress,
                            who has labored with much energy and success to give sound instruction
                            to her papile. The tone of the school is good, and we hope to see it
                            before long outgrowing its present premises. The English population in
                            the Shubra district is rapidly increasing, and we believe the school
                            will be a real blessing to the neighborhood. A word of praise should be
                            given to Miss Cooper and Miss Cullen, who assist Miss Taylor in her
                            work.</p> </div>

                            yesterday at Winth Chester House, Old Broad-street. A dividend 5 % for
                            the year was passed and the Board was given powers to increase the share
                            capital by £334,600, inaking the total authorized Preference capital
                            £1,250,000, which will enable the Board to provide funds as and when
                            required for further extensions. </p>
                        <p>The authorized capital of the company, together with that of the
                            Cairo-Helouan Railway, which was taken over on Monday, is now as
                            follows: </p>

                            made considerable progress in the last six years. </p>

                        <p>A telegram has been received in Cairo announcing the arrival at Bussorah
                            of Sir William Willcocks, who left Suez by the P. &amp;0. mail steamer
                            for Bombay about a month ago. Sir William will reach Baghdad next
                            Saturday, whence he will make the lengthened tour throughout the whole
                            of the province of Mesopotamia for which a fireman from the Sultan was
                            recently granted. </p>
                        <p>It is stated that Harari Pasha will not resign his present appointment
                            until the 1st May, and not on the 1st January as originally rumored. On
                            that date he will replace Sir P William Willcocks as managing director
                            of the company, the latter taking the direction of a new concern which
                            is to undertake the amelioration of some 100,000 feddans of land at
                            present "unirrigated'' and bring them under cultivation. We believe a
                            concession has been asked from the Government for this purpose, the

                        <p>In spite of cold and rather dull weather the first important race-day of
                            the Cairo season was a great success. There could be no two opinions as
                            to the quality of the racing. It was good, and the attendance had
                            reached very respectable proportions by 3 p.m., if a little thin during
                            the first race or two. Among those present were nearly all the principal
                            owners, of whom Khalil Pasha Khayat, with one first and two seconds, did
                            best. But for a mistake by Jenkins in the first race, he might have
                            obtained-1 ed another win, though Stillwell, on Parbon II, would in any
                            case have been a formidable competitor. The Grand Khedivial Steeplechase
                            produced an interesting race, but the great! The attraction of the day
                            was, of course, that for the Jubilee Stakes, which was won by Pantasia.
                            On ) weighing, however, Ibrahim Bey Cherif's joe-li key was about half a
                            pound underweight and the race went to Roland, which, if not a general
                            favorite, had been most confidently backed by his owner. Mathews, who
                            rode Amory and came in fourth, did not weigh out, and so lost the third
                            place, which would otherwise have fallen to him consequent disgust of
                            the hope-13 ful few who had backed Elie Bey Sursock's horse. In the last
                            race Moofid ran disappointingly and Roi de l'Air failed to keep up,
                            giving Khalil Pasha Khayal's Banaback a well deserved win. The Band of
                            the 2nd Royal Inniskilling 1 Fusiliers played during the afternoon, and
                            all the arrangements of the K.S.C. were excellent. The Pari Mutuel paid
                            pretty well, especially in the 2nd and 5th races. In the great race
                            India, Paik, and Latiff were most fancied by the public. Roland's
                            backing was limited-but successful.</p>
