                <p>SCENE ON 203-METRE HILL.</p>
                <p>LONDON, December 8. Reuter's correspondent before Port Arthur, who visited the
                    203-metre hill at the close of a week's struggle, says the scene was awful. The
                    crest of the bill was torn away and the trenches semi-obliterated. In a single
                    section of 100 yards of trenches there were 200 Russian dead and wounded,
                    horribly mangled by dynamite and grenades.</p>

                <p>St. PETERSBURG, December 7. The Russian correspondents at Mukden constantly refer
                    to the activity of the Chunchuses, who are now well organized under the famous
                    leader Tulisan. They are specially troublesome in their attempts to blow up
                    bridges and the railway.</p>
                <p>(Reuter.)</p>
                <p>MUKDEN, December 7. A tremendous cannonading with siege guns began yesterday
                    morning round Putiloff bill and the railway. The number of guns is constantly
                    increasing. It is supposed that important developments will follow.

                <p>ANGLO-FRENCH CONVENTION.</p>
                <p>ADOPTED BY SENATE.</p>
                <p>Paris, December 7. The Senate has adopted the Anglo-French Convention by 215
                    votes to 37. (Reuter.)</p>
                <p>PARIS, December 7. The Senate has passed the Anglo-French Convention. M. Delcassé
                    spoke of the happy | results of the entente with England and the advantages
                    obtained in West Africa and Morocco, which compensate for the concessions made
                    in Egypt and Newfoundland. (Havas.)</p>
                <p>Paris, December 8. The Senate adopted without a division the Franco-Siamese
                    Convention. M. Delcassé said that this treaty would assure to France a I
                    preponderance in the Mekong Basin without moving a single soldier, or expending
                    a centime.</p>
                <p>Replying to the debate on the Anglo-French Convention, M. Delcassé said that his
                    opponents had concentrated their criticisms on the question of Newfoundland, yet
                    all that France had abandoned was the valueless fish-erring rights, and she had
                    received in exchange important compensation elsewhere. This Convention was the
                    result of a foreign policy based upon a plan which had been followed
                    perseveringly for six years. In consequence of such plan, Spain and Italy had
                    been conciliated and Great Britain no longer saw in France anything else but a
                    tried worker, whom it would be difficult to replace in the field of peace and
                    concord.</p>

                    number contains some very interesting contributions which appeal to the resiuent
                    and visitor alike, and a feature is made of financial news of a very informing
                    character, to which a whole page is devoted. We believe that, as the season |
                    advances, new features, more intimately connected with the movements and doings
                    of our winter guests, will be added, and the attractiveness of the publication
                    enhanced by half-tone illustrations of local and topical events. It is the aim
                    of the editor to make his I journal reflect the non-political views of the</p>
                <p>residents of the Capital, and he hopes to receive the co-operation of the latter
                    in his task. The quality of the paper and printing leaves nothing to be
                    desired.</p>
                <p>THE KHEDIVE.</p>
                <p>The Khedive proceeded yesterday morning to Koubbeh Mosque, where he attended Bey.
                    ram prayers.</p>
                <p>The Beyram reception held at Abdeen Palace by his Highness was very largely
                    attended.</p>
                <p>To-morrow his Highness will open the horticultural exhibition at Ghezireh at 3
                    p.m.</p>
                <p>CHRISTMAS DAY. We hear that the British professors employed in the Secondary
                    Schools at Cairo will not, this year, get their Christmas Day free. Up to this
                    year they have been, almost without exception, allowed a holiday on December 25,
                    but this year, it is said, owing to the fact that the Arabic professors are
                    unable to take the whole day's work through insufficiency in numbers, they will
                    lose it.</p>
                <p>We are, of course, aware that Christmas Day, like other European holidays,
                    cannot, in a Moslem country, be observed to the same extent as in England, but
                    we think it a pity that the authorities of the Ministry of Public Instruction
                    cannot see their way to grant the concession to men,-many of whom are married
                    and would naturally prefer to spend the day at home, who have done bard, and in
                    some cases rather monotonous, work for some time past.</p>
                <p>THE LATE MRS. WILSON. The funeral of the late Mrs. W. J. Wilson took place
                    yesterday morning at the Old British Protestant Cemetery at Alexandria, and was
                    attended by many of the older members of the British Colony. The body was
                    brought from Cairo by the only son of the deceased lady, Mr. Louis Wilson, and
                    the funeral service was conducted by the Rey. W. Wormell.</p>

                <p>PRINCE'S VISIT TO EGYPT.</p>
                <p>PRINCE LEOPOLD ARRIVING</p>
                <p>ON TUESDAY.</p>
                <p>Prince Leopold of Battenberg left Kensington Palace this day week for Egypt. His
                    Highness travelled from Liverpool-street by the P. and O. boat train express to
                    Tilbury, where he embarked on the steamship Arabia for Port Said. Princess Henry
                    of Battenberg and Princess Ena were present at the station to bid him good-bye.
                    Lord William Cecil travelled with the Prince to Tilbury. His Highness is
                    expected at Port Said on Tuesday next and will proceed straight to Cairo. Lord
                    Cecil has engaged a suite of rooms for his Highness at the Hotel
                    d'Angleterre.</p>
                <p>THE SINAI EXPEDITION. Mr. Monk Porch, the well-known Oxonian Egyptologist, who is
                    on his way to explore the Sinai-tic peninsula in company with Pro essor Flinders
                    Petrie, has arrived at Suez and will start from there by camel. It is well known
                    that in ancient times large amounts of malachite were brought to Alexandria from
                    Sinai, and it is hoped that a large business may be developed by reviving the
                    export of this beautiful mineral.</p>
                <p>Professor Flinders Petrie, whose age will not enable him to endure as much
                    campaigning in the desert as he would like, will not undertake the search for
                    flint instruments, which is a subject very dear to Mr. Monk Porch's heart. This
                    search for malachite is a somewhat new departure for the professor, who has
                    hitherto confined his attention more to antiquities than to commerce. The
                    conjunction of these two able men should result in some very interesting
                    researches, as Sinai is in a great measure an undiscovered country.</p>
                <p>The old malachite mines are believed to have been located, but they have not been
                    explored in recent times.</p>
                <p>NUNGOVICH HOTELS. The election of the directors of the Nungovich Hotels Company
                    has been postponed owing to the illness of Dr. Page-May, who is suffering from
                    influenza.</p>
                <p>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</p>
                <p>LA GIOCONDA. Ponchielli's tuneful and favorite opera La Gioconda is so
                    well-known, and so truly appreciated by the majority of the opera-going I
                    public, that no surprise need be expressed at the audience which assembled last
                    evening and taxed the seating accommodation of the house to its utmost limits.
                    In spite of this, however, the performance failed to draw the house to any very
                    great extent in the first or second acts, and there appeared to be an
                    unaccountable coldness on each side of the footlights; even the moon beat &amp;
                    very hasty retreat. It was not until the closing of the third act, with its
                    tragic scene and magnificent finale, that the audience were thoroughly roused,
                    and all the artistes concerned were enthusiastically recalled again and again.
                    As La Gioconda Sigpa. Amelia Pinto created a very favorable impression, both
                    acting and singing with much artistic skill. Such a performance augurs well for
                    the success of the several operas in which this lady is to appear. Signa.
                    Margherita Julia was not altogether what we had anticipated as Laura Adorno. If
                    the business so painfully evident occasionally, in the lower register, was due
                    to cold, Signa. Julis was certainly very brave to have come forward. Her
                    performance otherwise was exceedingly good. In the role of Enzo Grimaldi Sig.
                    Francesco Bravi did not appear to be quite at ease, but whatever he lacked
                    histrionically he certainly made up for vocally. Signor Bravi possesses a fine
                    voice, which he has under good control, and although rather light for an opera
                    such as Gioconda, he scored a distinct success. His rendering of the favorite
                    "Cielo e mar" naturally brought forth the usual rounds of applause and
                    consequent encore. As Alvise Badoero, Sig. Carlo Walter acted with dignity and
                    sang, as he always does, with effect. Sig. Enrico Nani's performance was one
                    much above the average, his singing and acting being of high artistic merit
                    throughout the opera. Sig. Nani I will undoubtedly become a great favorite
                    during the season. The very distressing character of La Cieca was ably sustained
                    by Signa. Adele Ponzano. The two ballets danced during the evening were well
                    executed, and the chorus was even better than usual, the invisible chorus in
                    particular being exceedingly well rendered. Under the able bâton of Sig. Setti
                    the orchestra was excellent, although in the third act and finale the eyeballs
                    worked rather more than was pleasant for those sitting near.</p>
                <p>ALHAMBRA THEATRE. There was a large house at the Alhambra | last night to welcome
                    the new variety and ballet company which is now occupying the boards. The
                    company is composed of very good elements, and an excellent show was presented.
                    It would take up more space than we have at our disposal to enumerate the
                    various "turns" on the programme, so many and varied are these, but the
                    performances of "The Stewarts," equilibrists, Bepoil, French comique (who is, by
                    the way, an old favorite here), Mlle Rosensteel, "diseuse," Mlle Mignon,
                    balladist, and Mlle Ivon Hett, la poupée Parisienne, are worthy of special
                    mention. We must candidly confess the ballet, Les Amours du Papillon, did not
                    come up to our expectations, but this was probably due to the fact, announced,
                    that no less than three of the fair participants were indisposed. We hope for
                    better things in future.</p>

                <p>We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expresseded by our

                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                <p>Sir,--Having read the article on the above subject in your issue of yesterday's
                    date, and being interested in the ice business, will you please allow us a brief
                    space for a reply. Just previous to the commencement of the ice
                    season--unfortunately for the public as well as the owners-the Société Anonymous
                    Moulins d'Egypte's ice-works and flour-mills were almost entirely destroyed by
                    fire, and out of four tree plants one only remained intact. The motor power
                    having been destroyed by the fire, it was impossible to put these three ice
                    plants again in working condition in time for the season ; consequently the
                    above-named company were</p>
                <p>only working one plant instead of four, which in reduced their output of ice to
                    twelve tons re instead of forty-eight. The reason as to how the</p>
                <p>fourth ice plant could be worked, is that this is I plant is completely isolated
                    from the others, and</p>
                <p>11 connected to separate motor-power. Had this of company been working all four
                    ice plants, the mountain of ice in Alexandria would certainly as have been more
                    than sufficient to meet the of public requirements. It is easy to see from</p>
                <p>the above the reason why ice was high in m price, but the extra profit did not go
                    into the</p>
                <p>-pockets of the ice manufacturers, it was u reaped by the retail vendors, who
                    took - advantage of an exceptional situation. In r. conclusion we may add that
                    the three ice</p>
                <p>plants of the Sooiété Anonyme des Moulins e d'Egypte have been again erected, and
                    are in a position to be worked next season.</p>

                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE,</p>
                <p>Sir,--Frequent complaints are heard of dilatoriness on the part of the Telephone
                    Co., | but action amounting to breach of contract is, - I hope, rare. My
                    experience of a few days ago</p>
                <p>is the following: | A customer in Ramleh, who is &amp; subscriber to</p>
                <p>the Telephone Co., endeavored to telephone to me relative to the repetition of an
                    important order and also for some urgently-wanted medicine for his wife. To his
                    astonishment communication was refused him, the employé informing him that, were
                    he to do so, it would entail loss of his post. Imagining that &amp; mistake had
                    occurred, my client again endeavored to communicate with me, but met with
                    refusal on three separate occasions. He then, at considerable loss of time and
                    inconvenience, came to Alexandria and gave the order in person.</p>
                <p>I take it for granted that the aim and Te object of the Telephone Company is to
                    furnish</p>
                <p>telephonic communication amongst subscribers, and with a view to information on
                    the subject, and this particular case in question, I wrote to the Alexandria
                    manager per registered letter and telegraphed to the general manager in Cairo
                    requesting an explanation. This I probably being to them &amp; matter of sueh
                    frequent occurrence and of so little moment, neither of the aforesaid gentlemen
                    thought fit to reply to my letter or telegram. I therefore crave the courtesy of
                    your paper with a view to learning if other subscribers have been treated in a
                    like manner.</p>
                <p>Yours truly,</p>

                <p>CAIRO.. ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                <p>The Cairo Alexandria cricket match began yesterday in very uncertain and squally
                    weather, which several times interrupted play. Alexandria began well, having 140
                    on the | board for 8 wickets before lunch, owing to some fine batting by H. B.
                    Carver, the two</p>
                <p>Maclarens, and Strange. After lunch, how however, the whole side got out for 199,
                    Lockett i and Graves getting the wickets. Cairo began</p>
                <p>badly in losing Lockett, who had hard luck in getting out off his pads, but
                    thanks to Capt. Potter, who played a very steady innings and</p>
                <p>was not out at the close of play, they did a better than their start promised. At
                    the close el of play the score was 58 for 3 wickets, so that Alexandria may be
                    said to hold a decided lead.</p>
                <p>The Married v. Single cricket match on Saturday will not be played. A Rugby
                    football match, Cairo e. The Provinces, will replace it, and will certainly be

                    well-known Greek paper of Alexandria, Telegraphs. The funeral will take place
                    this afternoon at 3 o'clock.</p>

                <p>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET. (FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>London, December. 4. The political situation since our last has not had much
                    effect on Stock Exchange prices. A further delay has taken place in the
                    negotiations foreshadowed in our previous article, owing to the fact that the
                    war party in Russia had again got the upper hand, and have been trying to
                    utilize the Indian frontier question to delay matters. One of the features in
                    Egyptian stocks this week has been the renewed demand for Salt and Soda shares.
                    The supply of shares on this market being almost exhausted, the natural result
                    is that a further considerable advance in price has taken place, and there are
                    at this moment large buying orders at 42s. which are still unsupplied. The price
                    is an exaggerated one and offers a fine opportunity for profit-taking; at the
                    same time those on your side who understand the position of affairs of this
                    company will be able to draw their own conclusions. There has also been during
                    the past week an active market in Egyptian Mining shares, notably Nile Valleys
                    and United Africans. The former have been over 31. and the latter 2. There has
                    been a set back from those prices during the last day or two, due in part to
                    profit-taking, and it is also stated that the outside broker company which has
                    had to meet its creditors had considerable interests in these shares.</p>
                <p>It looks as if the check is only a temporary one; the market might take a fresh
                    start at any moment. United Africans, which have fallen to 15 (their price
                    to-day), look, cheap. It is said that they have, in cash and liquid assets,
                    sufficient to pay about £2.10.0. per share. Bank shares are steady, Nationals
                    231, and Agricultural 104. Delta Light Railway Preference are &amp; strong
                    market at 15 and look like going better still, on their satisfactory report just
                    issued. In general markets South Africans are easier-but with a good undertone,
                    and a decided widening of business. Internationals are firm on the whole, and
                    the American Market remains &amp; wonderfully good one.</p>
