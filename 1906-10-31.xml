                    <head> LONDON PRESS ON EGYPT. </head>
                    <p> So great is the interest now being taken in Egypt by the home Press, that
                        certain London papers have expressed their intention to send out special
                        correspondents to study the affairs of the country. Up to the present we
                        Have always considered that the average Britisher showed a remarkable
                        ignorance of this country, in spite of its importance both politically and
                        commercially, and we are glad to observe any evidence of awakening interest.
                        The Britisher has for long been accused, and to a large measure rightly, of
                        lack of enterprise, and the businessman of Egypt especially grumbles at his
                        hesitation to out British goods on the market here and the restrictions with
                        which he hedges round <!--illegible--> would-be agents. On every side we
                        see foreign firms creeping in where we should have come in first, and,
                        though we hardly agree with the pessimists who prognosticate the day when
                        Great Britain will be a secondary or even tertiary commercial power in
                        Egypt, we full agree with those who say that the Old Country fails to
                        realise what an enormous field is open to her sons. </p>
                    <p> The London journalists who are about to visit this country have, therefore,
                        a great and serious opportunity before them, and we await the results of
                        their visits with interest and even with anxiety. The political and
                        commercial affairs of Egypt are not such as can be grasped by a cursory
                        glance. Writers of such articles as we look forward to reading must,
                        necessarily, generalise and this entails deep study and searching inquiry
                        among competent men who know the country au fond, as far as that is
                        possible. It is only in such a way that the articles can be made of real
                        value. </p>
                    <p> We do not give this warning without reason. About a fortnight ago there
                        appeared in a prominent London paper an article of a column and a half
                        purporting to deal with the future in Egypt. If the writer's idea was to
                        provide the reading public with facts which might indicate to them what the
                        future of Egypt is likely to be, he failed miserably. The article, indeed,
                        is chiefly remarkable for its verbosity, and a considerable part of it is
                        devoted to a picturesque description of a journey which he made to Zagazig
                        and a hardly more à propos account of an interview which he had with an
                        officer who served under Arabi Pasha at Tel el Kebir. </p>
                    <p> And even with the more important parts of the article there is much fault to
                        be found. As an opening sentence the writers says: "Ten years ago Egypt was
                        a country of the dead." All who have studied this country must know that in
                        1896, during which year her revenues totalled L.E. 10,260,000, she was very
                        much alive, and had already made a good stride towards her present-day
                        prosperity. Ten years ago her imports showed an increase over the previous
                        year of L.E. 1,271,000 and her exports an increase of L.E. 568,000. Ten
                        years ago Egypt exported 4,008,000 cantars of cotton, an increase of 148,000
                        cantars over 1895. Ten years ago the railway receipts amounted L.E.
                        1,822,000 and 9,864,000 passengers were conveyed by the railways;
                        telegraphic receipts amounted to L.E. 53,000; 1,286 steamships cleared
                        1,943,000 tons of goods at Alexandria, where the receipts of the port were
                        L.E. 141,000. And this from a country of the dead! </p>

                    <p> Yacoub Pasha Artin has done much for Egyptian education during his tenure of

                        of office a certain amount of hostile criticism and a very general respect.
                        Whatever may have been said of the retiring Under-Secretary during the
                        students' strike, which his uncompromising attitude did much to quell, we
                        are convinced that the general sentiment at his departure will be one of
                        unmixed regret. He has done much for education, and his studies on Oriental
                        subjects will be referred to by the historian when the very names of his
                        predecessors are forgotten. Sir Richard Burton acknowledged his debt to
                        Artin Pasha's immense knowledge of Oriental customs, religion, and
                        institutions, and the public service must be the poorer for the retirement
                        of one who fully deserves the compliment of being termed, in Oriental
                        phrase, "a treasure-house of hidden knowledge and a star of refulgent

                        contemporary, resulted in the interference of two shawishes and an agent of
                        the secret police, who, it was alleged, held the controller (a Frenchman)
                        tight for the conductor (a native) to pommell him. </p>
                    <p> The facts of the case were communicated officially to the Press yesterday
                        afternoon as follows:— </p>
                    <p> "The inquiry held into this affair has shown that the controller violently
                        assaulted the conductor, and that the police intervened to put a stop to the
                        fight. A large crowd collected and the police requested the controller to
                        accompany them to the caracol, but he refused. </p>
                    <p> "Meanwhile a janissary of the French Consulate arrived, and the controller
                        “went to the kism in the company of the janissary and the police. </p>
                    <p> The janissary deposed that the police agents did not strike the controller;
                        several other persons have given evidence to the same effect, among them an
                        employé of the Government schools, an Italian yousbashi of police, and a

                    <p>Lord Cranbrook is dead. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>The Right Hon. Gathorne Gathorne Hardy, Viscount Cranbrook G.C.S.I., P.C.,
                        was the third son of the late Mr. John Hardy, of Dunstall Hall,
                        Staffordshire (who for many years represented the town of Bradford in
                        Parliament), and of Isabel, daughter of Mr. Richard Gathorne, of Kirkby,
                        Lonsdale. He was born at Bradford, Oct. 1, 1814, and educated at Shrewsbury
                        School, and at Oriel College Oxford, where he gained a second-class in
                        classics, and took the degree of B.A. in 1836. He was called to the Bar at
                        the Inner Temple in 1840, and practised as a barrister for several years.
                        Mr. Hardy unsuccessfully contested Bradford in the Conservative interest in
                        1847, but was returned to the House of Commons in 1856 as member for
                        Leominster, which borough he continued to represent till the celebrated
                        Oxford election in July, 1865, when, after an exciting contest, he defeated
                        Mr. Gladstone by a majority of 180, this being the principal Conservative
                        success at the general election of that year. In 1868 Mr. Hardy was
                        appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in Lord Derby's
                        second administration; on the formation of Lord Derby's third administration
                        in July, 1866, he became President of the Poor-Law Board; and on the
                        resignation of Mr. Walpole, in May, 1867, he was nominated Secretary of
                        State for the Home Department, which office he held till the resignation of
                        the Conservative Ministry in Dec. 1868. On the formation of Mr. Disraeli's
                        administration in Feb. 1874, Mr. Hardy was nominated Secretary of State for
                        War. In May, 1878, he was raised to the House of Peers by the title of
                        Viscount Cranbrook, of Hemsted, in the County of Kent; and he assumed, by
                        royal licence, the additional surname of Gathorne. In the same year he
                        succeeded the Marquis of Salisbury as Secretary of State for India, and held
                        that office until the Conservatives retired from office in May, 1880. In
                        Lord Salisbury's Cabinet of 1885, and again in 1886, Lord Cranbrook held the
                        office of Lord President of the Council, and in 1892, on the resignation of
                        the Government, he was created Earl of Cranbrook and Baron Medway of Hemsted
                        in the county of Kent. He married in 1838. Jane, daughter of Mr. James Orr,
                        of Holyrood House, co. Down. He is succeeded in the title by his eldest son,
                        the Hon. J. S. Gathorne-Hardy, Lord Medway.</p>

                    <p>The sentence has aroused but little criticism. A French Cairo contemporary
                        remarks:— "However severe this decision, it has been approved by all the
                        British colony. There are certain clownish tricks and vulgarities which
                        Europeans, regardless of nationality, must absolutely forbid. The judgment

                    <p>The two latest additions to MacMillan's Colonial Library are "Chippinge," a
                        political romance of the days of the Reform Bill, by Mr. Stanley Weyman, and
                        "A Lady of Rome," by Mr. Marion Crawford. Mr. Weyman's novel is a very vivid
                        piece of writing and the interest never flags from beginning to end. "A Lady
                        of Rome" is well worthy of the reputation of the author of "Saracinesca."
                        Both novels are well worth reading, and fully sustain the reputation of
                        MacMillan's Colonial Library for excellence of printing and moderate

                    <head>THE ERA OF REFORM.</head>
                    <p>Commenting on the appointment of the new Minister of Public Instruction,
                        Hassan Abd el Rezek, in the "Moayad," says:—</p>
                    <p>We have learnt with joy of the nomination of Saad Bey Zaglool to the post of
                        Minister of Public Instruction. The news has relieved us in a certain
                        measure of the sorrow we have borne for some time, and is probably the
                        harbinger of noble reforms. Saad Bey is a man of high principles, zealous,
                        independent, and energetic. The nation sees in his appointment a ray of hope
                        pointing to the sincere execution of genuine reforms by the authorities.
                        Recent incidents—the complaint of the Legislative Council to the Prince of
                        Wales, the demands of the General Assembly, the demands of the higher
                        students, the critiques of journalists, and the complaints of the whole
                        people concerning the condition of public instruction in Egypt—have brought
                        about this change, which is, in our opinion, a proof of the intention of the
                        authorities to introduce reforms.</p>
                    <p>We thank H.H. the Khedive and Lord Cromer for the appointment. The attitude
                        of the latter proves that he feels the necessity of abandoning severity in
                        favour of conciliatory measures towards the nation and of confiding posts of
                        responsibility towards its most capable members, an attitude which is truly
                        worthy of the honour of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>May the new Minister allow us to recall the wise advice which he gave to the
                        proprietor of the "Moayad" in 1891? This advice gave the writer an energy
                        and perseverance which were his capital and which won him the confidence of
                        his friends,</p>
                    </div> <div type="item">
                    <head>THE ADVISERS.</head>
                    <p>"Al Moayad," whose dislike of the English occupation is well-known, shows
                        some venom in a long article criticising the Advisers, from which we extract
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>The Advisors form the axis of the Government Departments round which all work
                        moves; and did they work in secret, as they used to do some years ago, they
                        would very much resemble the saints called by a set of Moslem fanatics
                        (Sophies) the Aktab, whom they believe, to have the power to govern the
                        whole universe secretly.</p>
                    <p>These Advisors attend at his Lordship's mansion every morning and afternoon;
                        they do everything they wish in the Ministries; had they taken all
                        responsibility upon themselves, then would they have been the true ministers
                        disguised in the names of Advisers.</p>
                    <p>We do not deny that his Lordship furnishes these Advisors with sound opinions
                        and honourable principles; and let us suppose that he does not fail to
                        rebuke them for errors. But is this sufficient to justify placing the reins
                        of Government in the hands of five Englishmen?</p>
                    <p>Why should they be all Englishmen? Why should they not be all Egyptians, or
                        at least some of them?</p>
                    <p>Is it impossible for his Lordship to choose from among the Egyptians five old
                        or young men qualified to fill these posts and in whom he can place his
                        confidence and thus gain by their services what he would by the services of
                        Englishmen? Cannot his Lordship realise that his supervision, which has its
                        uses in ennobling the souls of Englishmen, would also be useful in ennobling
                        the goals of Egyptians?</p>
                    <p>What we now propose we only propose theoretically, and we hope our readers,
                        especially Englishmen, will not be led to think that we endeavour to usurp
                        such posts, as have been created for them and them only, or that we try to
                        gain the confidence of his Lordship, a thing more inaccessible than the
                        stars.</p>
                    <p>If the Adviser must be an Englishman, young or old, experienced or
                        inexperienced, why should he be overbearing and haught, imperious and
                        contemptuous; so much so that he does not condescend to become acquainted
                        with the high class of the people except for the purpose of obtaining useful
                        information? He may pass ten years in the country without learning about it
                        what the tourist can learn in the winter season, since the latter may
                        interrogate now and then his interpreter or the servant of the hotel on
                        subjects that remain unknown to the Adviser through his haughtiness and
                        contempt.</p>

                    <head>"THE GEISHA."</head>
                    <p>Last night, at the Khedivial Opera House, we had the real "Geisha" with
                        proper uniforms, proper songs, and words which had not suffered from
                        translation—a welcome change after the Italian representations recently
                        given in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The performance was distinctly good. Mr. Cole seemed, for the first time it
                        must be said, somewhat tired; he was stereotype at moments and only gave us
                        two verses of “Chin Chin Chinaman.” We hoped for encore verses, but he
                        confined his repetition to the dance. Mr. Lester made his points very
                        cleverly, and had many wise "saws" with most up-to-date instances. Miss
                        Corlass looked very charming and sang, danced, and acted as gracefully as
                        over in the principal <!--illegible--> of Mimosa San. Miss O'Connor as
                        the French Mousmé and Miss Morra as Molly Seamore were most lively, Mr.
                        Percival gave his one song in excellent style, and we must not forget Mr.
                        Attwell, who gave "Star of my Soul” well, but otherwise seemed rather under
                        par. He appeared as if he did not quite care for his part, but, as we have
                        said, it was a capital performance and the only real fault was the
                        occasional lapse of the orchestra. The cornet was lamentably flat all
                        through "Star of my Soul." We must, however, remember that the orchestra is
                        local, and for all Mr. Warwick Major's abilities, we cannot expect
                        perfection in music which the orchestra had probably seen only once or twice
                        before the performance.</p>

                        introduced to his Excellency by Fakhry Pasha and Mr. Dunlop.</p>
                    <p>Hassan Pasha Radwan, Moudir of Gharbieh, will shortly retire on pension, and
                        it is expeoted that Mohamed Shukri Pasha, Moudir of Menoufieh, will be
                        transferred to the Gharbieh moudirieh.</p>
                    <p>According to the “Misr," Saleb Pasha Sabet, president of the Native Court of
                        Appeal, intends to resign in March next, when he will be entitled to a full
                        pension.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. L. M. Iddings left Alexandria for Cairo yesterday evening.</p>
                    <p>Count Bolesta de Kosziebrodski, Austro-Hungarian Diplomatic Agent, called
                        upon Lord Cromer yesterday.</p>
                    <p>M. Mihram Kalfayan, Persian Consul at Alexandria, arrived here yesterday from
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Sir William Willcocks, who spent the whole summer in Cyprus, is returning
                        there next Wednesday, and expects to pass the winter on the island. Indeed,
                        it is probable that Sir William will make his permanent residence there.</p>
                    <p>According to a native contemporary, Helbawi Bey, who had a private interview
                        on Saturday last with Mr. Machell, is shortly to obtain an administrative
                        post.</p>
                    <p>Maitre Carton de Wiart is leaving Cairo shortly for London and will be absent

                        recommendation of a medical board.</p>

                    <head>THE LOVE POTION CASE.</head>
                    <p>The Mixed Misdemeanour Court of Alexandria gave judgment on the 29th instant
                        in the case brought against the Tantal chemist, who was accused of seriously
                        injuring a native man and woman by giving them a live potion, which the
                        Sanitary Administration declared to be a most noxious concoction of
                        poisonous ingredients. The full details of the affair were given in a
                        previous issue. The judgment runs as follows:—</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu'il résulte da procès-verbal même du 13 mai 1906 que la liqueur
                        vendue par Mohamed Rayan sous le nom do potion de carottes a été absorbée à
                        diverses reprises par différentes personnes et notamment par Ahmed Effendi
                        el Maghrabi lui-même sans produire d'effets fâcheux.</p>
                    <p>Que si le dimanche 18 mai 1906 Ahmed Effendi el Maghrabi et sa femme se sont
                        trouvés malades, il ne résulte de rien que ce soit par suite de l'absorption
                        de contenu de la potion vendue par Mohamed Rayan : qu'en effet, la bouteille
                        contenant cette potion a été ouverte par el Maghrabi lui-même, que le
                        contenu a pu en être modifié par lui ou par toute autre personne. Que ses
                        déolarations ne peuvent suffire å identifier le contenu de la bouteille.</p>
                    <p>Attendu que le prévenu a donné lui-même la composition de son médicament; que
                        le M.P. ne fait pas la preuve que la potion délivrée à El Maghrabi ait eu
                        une composition autre que celle indiquée par la praticien.</p>
                    <p>Attendu que celui-ci déclare que le liquide qui lui a été présenté semble
                        avoir subi une addition ou une altération.</p>
                    <p>Attendu que l'incorporation d'une substance nocive, fût-elle établie, ne
                        saurait, en l'état, l'être à l'encontre de prévenu, aucune autre personne
                        que le plaignant n'ayant connu les faits qui ont pa se passer entre le
                        moment de l'ouverture de la bouteille et celui de l'absorption d'une partie
                        de son contenu.</p>
                    <p>Que dès lors une analyse de saurait être concluante au point de vue tout au
                        moins de la poursuite actuelle.</p>
                    <p>Qa'il en est d'autant plus ainsi que le &lt;!--illegible--> saisi par la
                        police a été ultérieurement &lt;!--illegible--> par un agent, et le contenu
                        transvasé sans aucun controle ni garantie dans une autre fiole.</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs, statuant publiquement et contradictoirement et le M.P.
                        entendu, reçoit en la forme Moh. Rayan, opposant an jugement du 8 septembre
                        1906. Au fond, relaxe le prévena des fins de la plainte sans dépens.</p>

                    <p>M. SUZANNE. </p>
